There are severals factors that make testing mobile applications more challenging process for mobile app developers. Those are the device variation, fragmentation of manufacturers, screen size, operating systems and mobile network operators that exist in nowadays (Chak). Among those challenges, I think the most relevant or biggest mobile testing challenge could be a fragmentation of devices end-users have in their pocket.

According to statistics, as for August 2015, there were more than 24,000 different Android devices available in the market and they have different size, shape, and hardware that give mobile app developers more challenge in testing their applications (Hechtel). Also there are different type of hardwares that run on different operating systems like Apple or Samsung. For this reason, mobile application developers would have difficulty in testing their applications due to compatibility issues.
