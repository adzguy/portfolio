There are severals factors that make testing mobile applications more challenging process for mobile application developers or testers. These are the device variations, fragmentation of manufacturers, different screen sizes, different operating systems and mobile network operators that existing factors nowadays (Chak). Among these challenges, I would like to argue that the most relevant and biggest mobile testing challenge is the fragmentation of devices that the end-users have in their pocket.

<br>
According to statistics, as for August 2015, there were more than 24,000 different Android devices available in the market. Android device manufacturers vary immensely on brands. Each brand has its own shape, size, and hardware that would give taught time to test developer applications on that devices (Hechtel).
