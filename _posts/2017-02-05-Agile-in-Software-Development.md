Agile process methodology in software development has four main principles that distinguish itself from other early software process models. These are individuals and interactions over processes and tools; working software over documentation; customer collaboration over negotiation; responding to change over following a plan (Boehm, 2016, p. 8). These values provide opportunities to assess the direction of a project throughout the development lifecycle. For example, when a development team stops and re-evaluates the direction of a project every two weeks or four weeks, there would be always time to adjust or change it in another direction that was not planned at the beginning. Due to the result of this approach to develop, it greatly reduces development cost and mostly itâ€™s time to market. Whereas, when we consider sequential process model, it does everything opposite to agile model of development.
