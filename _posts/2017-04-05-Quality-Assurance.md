Black-box testing strategy treats software that is under test as a black-box without knowing its internals and uses software interfaces to ensure that they are working as expected. Whereas, a white-box testing strategy which is also known as clear box testing or glass box testing looks inside the software that is being tested and uses that information as one of the processes in testing. In other words, black-box testing validates the requirements and specifications while white-box testing validates the code of the software (Bartlett).

They both have its advantages and disadvantages and I think they almost equally important to have them in testing the software. According to a site called Technology Conversations, the blogger Viktor Farcic states that one of the advantages of white-box testing is that it is efficient in finding errors and problems in software compare to black-box testing. Although, he has not shown any proof of that statement. I think he states that because the maximum coverage is obtained due to required internal knowledge of the software, whereas the internal knowledge is not needed in black-box testing.
