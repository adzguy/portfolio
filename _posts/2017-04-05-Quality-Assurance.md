Black-box testing strategy treats software that is under test as a black-box

without knowing its internals or software interfaces to ensure that they are

working as expected. Whereas, a white-box testing strategy, also known as

clear box testing or glass box testing, looks inside the software that is being

tested then uses that information as one of the processes in testing. In other

words, black-box testing validates the requirements and specifications while

white-box testing validates the code of the software (Bartlett).

<br>
They both have its advantages and disadvantages. They both equally important to

have them in testing the software. According to a site called Technology

Conversations, the blogger Viktor Farcic states that one of the advantages of

white-box testing is that it is efficient in finding errors and problems in

software compare to black-box testing. Although, he has not shown any proof of

that statement. I think he states it that way because the maximum coverage is

obtained due to required internal knowledge of the software, whereas the

internal knowledge is not needed in black-box testing.
