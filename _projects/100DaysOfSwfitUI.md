# 100 Days Of SwfitUI

I started the 100 Days Of SwiftUI Challenge where I am spending at average couple hours a day of coding in Swift programming language for 100 days. I started learning iOS development with user interface tool kit called UIKit during my Colleges years. After watching Apple’s WWDC19 conference, I felt I should get on this new tool kit called SwiftUI. First I started with Apple’s developer page learning from tutorials of SwiftUI then I found 100 Days Of SwiftUI challenge and started coding, credits to [@twostraws](https://twitter.com/twostraws){:target="_blank"}. Below is and would be a recap of everything I have accomplished during 100 days of SwiftUI.

# Days 1…15: Introduction to Swift
In those days, I covered all the fundamentals of the Swift programming language even though I have been coding in Swift. There were short quizzes to solve after each topic completion. I mostly did those quizzes. I combined few days to finish faster just because I was behind the other challengers. I would recommend that you give good amount of time to each topic to master them.

# Days 16…24: Starting SwiftUI
In those days, I started building real SwiftUI apps. There were three projects. The first one, with together we created [WeSplit](https://github.com/adzguy/WeSplit){:target="_blank"} app which its a check-splitting app that you use after eating at a restaurant - you enter the amount cost of your food, select how much of a tip your giving, and many people are splitting with, then it tells you how much each person needs to pay.

After first project, there was a challenge to create your own app with similar view. From the option that’s given, I chose to create [Temperature](https://github.com/adzguy/ConvertTemp){:target="_blank"}, and [Volume](https://github.com/adzguy/VolumeConvrt){:target="_blank"} conversion apps. I also posted them on my twitter [@imadzguy](https://twitter.com/imadzguy){:target="_blank"}. <br>
The second project was about to use stacks such as VStack, HStack, ZStack to arrange views. Also colors, frames, buttons with images, and showing alert message at the end. Together we created [GuessTheFlag](https://github.com/adzguy/GuessTheFlag){:target="_blank"} app which is a guessing game that helps users learn some of the many flags of the world. <br>
On our third project, we focused on two fundamental components of SwiftUI: Views and Modifiers. We went through lots of details such as why SwiftUI use struts instead of classes, what’s behind the main SwiftUI view, why SwiftUI use “some View” for its view type, and sort of modifiers such as like conditional, environmental, and custom modifiers. In the end of this third project, we went back to our own created apps to change and create modifiers inside the code. Basically, we refactored our codes. 

# Day 25: Consolidation
The 25th day, there was a challenge to create an app using what we covered in days 16 to 24. The app I created was a brain training game app that challenges players to win or lose at rock, paper, scissors. You can check on it in my GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/adzguy/RockPaperScissors){:target="_blank"}. 

# Days 26…34: Expanding my skills
In these days, we will be creating three projects. The first project we created together was a BetterRest app. This app basically does alert your ideal bed time asking you three questions. When do you want to wake up? How many hours of sleep do you want? And how many cups of coffee do you drink a day? I was introduced to DataPicker, Stepper, navigationBarItems, Date, DateComponents, and DateFormatter in SwiftUI. Moreover, I had learnt more about things we can built with using Apple’s frameworks like as Create ML and Core ML. I was familiar with Core ML when I created my Image detection app before SwiftUI. In this project, we created a machine learning model to use in our prediction with the accuracy of 89 percent to our ideal bed time using csv format data using Create ML framework. At the end of this project, the challenge was to change user interface so that it always shows its ideal bed time instead showing alert.

Now, more is to come…
